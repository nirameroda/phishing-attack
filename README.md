## PHISHING ATTACK DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND GENETIC ALGORITHMS

This project focusses on the phishing url detection as suspicious,phishing,legitimate.

The project uses genetic algorithm to optimize the results of phishing url detection using machine learning.

The genetic algorithm selects the best subset of features which are important for phishing attack detection.
